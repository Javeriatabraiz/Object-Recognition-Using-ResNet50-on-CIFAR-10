# Object-Recognition-Using-ResNet50-on-CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates how to perform object recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the ResNet50 model. The notebook guides you through the process of loading and preprocessing the dataset, building the ResNet50 model, training it, and evaluating its performance. The goal is to provide a hands-on example of applying deep learning techniques to image classification tasks.


**Overview**

The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 classes of images, to showcase how a deep convolutional neural network like ResNet50 can be applied to object recognition. The approach leverages the strengths of the ResNet50 architecture, known for its deep residual learning, to improve classification performance on this popular image dataset.


**Features**

Data Handling: Loading and preprocessing of the CIFAR-10 images.
Model Implementation: Building the ResNet50 model for object recognition.
Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluating its accuracy.
Visualization: Displaying training progress and sample predictions to better understand model performance.
